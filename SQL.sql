------------------WINDOW FUNCTION --------------
-- use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their separate identities.
-- RANK
SELECT rest_id, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rest_id) as all_rank FROM location;
SELECT rest_id, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY parent_region_id) as region_rank FROM location; --- !!!! bie jia rest_id

-- AVG
SELECT rest_id, (avg(parent_region_id) over())::INT AS all_avg from location;
SELECT rest_id, (avg(parent_region_id) over(PARTITION BY parent_region_id))::INT AS reg_avg from location;

-- SUM
SELECT rest_id, (SUM(parent_region_id) over())::INT AS all_sum from location;
SELECT rest_id, (SUM(parent_region_id) over(PARTITION BY parent_region_id))::INT AS reg_sum from location;
SELECT rest_id, (SUM(parent_region_id) over(PARTITION BY parent_region_id ORDER BY rest_id))::INT AS reg_sum from location; -- incremental

-----------USEFUL FUNCTIONS ----------
